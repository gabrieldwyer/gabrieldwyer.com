Instructions:

Chicken Marinade:
- Cut the chicken up into small chunks. The smaller the better. This works best with fresh chicken from the deli. Put in small container or ziplock bag
- Add salt, pepper, coriander seeds (lots of these), paprika, minced garlic, and a touch of cumin to the chicken.
- Add oil, a dash of barbecue sauce
- Mix well
- Marinade overnight


Chips:
- Pick LARGE potatoes when you buy them
- Cut the potatoes into large chips
- Rinse the chips in water
- Blanche (boil) the potatoes in water until the chips begin to break
- As soon as the chips begin to break, drain and allow to cool to room temperature
- When the chips are cool, add them to the fridge
- When cold, separate the chips on a tray and freeze them
- When frozen, the chips can be combined in a bag or container and stored

- Preheat the oven to ~180-200 degrees (hot but not too hot)
- Pull the potatoes out from the freezer and spread over a tray. Lubricate with oil well. Salt lightly.
- Cook until golden brown. Usually takes about 30 minutes but will vary from oven to oven
- Put the chips in a bowl and toss with salt and a pinch of paprika

Stir Fry:

- Dice some onions. Roughly one onion for every piece of chicken. Cook until lightly brown.
- Cut up some chillis and a little garlic. Add to onions.
- Dice up mushrooms and add to the pan
- When the mushrooms are soft, add the chicken and mix thoroughly. Tongs work well for this.
- Cook until almost cooked through. Be careful, the chicken will cook quickly, especially if cut very small. The chicken will over-cook quickly
- Before the chicken is fully cooked, begin to add the spinach to wilt. Add slowly, and fold in with tongs.
- Garnish with lemon
- Once all the spinach has been added (but not fully wilted), take it off the heat. Continue to fold in the spinach until fully wilted.
- Add the

Serve:
- To serve, fill a third of the bowl with hot chips. Cover the chips in grated cheese. Add the chicken - veg stir fry mixture until the bowl is two thirds full. Add sauces.

Feel free to mix and match the veges used in the stir-fry etc.
Most important steps are to cut the chicken up small, cook the chips twice, and to add the chicken late in the stir fry process. Everything else is up for grabs.
